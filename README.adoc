# Betrusted Embedded Controller

The embedded controller (EC) is a UP5K FPGA responsible for secondary
power management functions, and for intermediating between the trusted
comms port on the SoC and the untrusted wifi stack.

From the strict security model, the EC is in the untrusted domain, and
the core SoC must be robust against arbitrary remote exploits in the EC.

Compiled documentation: https://ci.betrusted.io/betrusted-ec/doc/[latest register set], https://ci.betrusted.io/betrusted-ec/rustdoc/betrusted_pac/[latest rust API documentation]

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have a toolchain installed, including a compiler, Python 3.5+, `nextpnr-ice40`, and `yosys`.  These can all be obtained by downloading the [Fomu toolchain](https://github.com/im-tomu/fomu-toolchain/releases/latest) and adding it to your `PATH`.
1. Check out this repo with `git clone --recurse-submodules <repo>`.
1. Run `./betrusted-ec.py --revision=pvt` (or `python3 ./betrusted-ec.py --revision=pvt`) to build the "PVT" version of the EC
1. Run `cargo xtask hw-image` to build the burnable ROM image
1. Run `cargo xtask docs` to update the HTML document tree
1. Run `cargo xtask push <target> [idfile]` to push the files to a Raspberry Pi with a debug hat for burning. `idfile` is the ssh ID file if you use one.

## Debugging Notes
The UP5K is debugged principally via wishbone-tool running over a UART, using
a Raspberry Pi with the custom debug HAT and cable. It's also assumed that
you have installed and cloned the `betrusted-scripts` repo (https://github.com/betrusted-io/betrusted-scripts/)
on the Raspberry Pi. The commands in this section are run on the Rasperry Pi
thus configured.

Note that the debugging interface is more stable when power is applied from
the debug cable itself using the `vbus_on.sh` script (rather than being
applied via USB or relying on the battery).

The EC UART port is selected by running the `betrusted-scripts/uart_up5k.sh` script.

`wishbone-tool` has some trouble reliably making connection with the wisbone
bridge over UART if it is not started immediately after the configuration
sequence. Thus it's recommended to invoke it using the following short
script:

`./config_up5k.sh && sudo ./start-gdb-up5k.sh`

The `start-gdb-up5k.sh` command does two things:

1. Create a GDB server, which you can connect to on port 3333
2. Tunnel UART to the console, so that `sprintln` calls on the UP5K can print out

Note that if you do compile the EC kernel with debug printing enabled, you
/must/ have the wishbone tunnel connected, otherwise the firmware will hang
as the UART buffer fills up and it will block execution.

Before attempting to use GDB for debugging, be sure to disable the
watchdog timer, or else the EC will continuously reset itself before
you're able to do anything over GDB. See the `Cargo.toml` for notes
on this.

To connect to the EC for GDB debugging, you must have a version of
the riscv GDB toolchain installed. For example, from an Ubuntu host,
you may be able to run `riscv64-unknown-elf-gdb`, and then use
`file target/riscv32i-unknown-none-elf/release/sw` to load the
firmware for debugging, and then `target remote <raspberry_pi_ip>:3333`
to connect to the Raspberry Pi.

## WF200 firmware
The EC image is intimately linked to the WF200 firmware image that is
presumed to be burned into the FLASH memory. Please consult `hal_wf200.rs`
for `WFX_FIRMWARE_OFFSET` and `WFX_FIRMWARE_SIZE`. In particular, when
updating the firmware, the `WFX_FIRMWARE_SIZE` parameter should also be
updated.

## Updating ##

To update the repo to the upstream version, including all dependencies, run:

```sh
git pull
git submodule update --recursive
```

## Using lxbuildenv.py Environment ##

`lxbuildenv` is a Python module.  It sets up the build environment and ensures you have the correct dependencies.  To use it, start your program off with:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import lxbuildenv
```

*`lxbuildenv.py` has some very surprising behaviors* that you should be aware of:

1. In order to set environment variables such as `PYTHONHASHSEED`, `lxbuildenv` will actually re-exec the Python interpreter.  This will, among other things, cause the pid to change.  *This is why lxbuildenv should be imported first*.
1. The environment variable `PYTHONPATH` is replaced to include every directory under `deps/`.  If you rely on `PYTHONPATH` to be something else, this may surprise you.
1. `lxbuildenv` has several command line parameters that it can accept.  To display these, run your command with the `--lx-help` parameter.
1. The `deps/` directory includes its own `site.py` implementation, adapted from a Debian implementation.  This is because some distros force `/usr/share/python/site-packages/` to be first in the dependency list, which causes confusing dependency interactions.  If you're relying on site packages being in a certain order, this may cause problems.  You can try deleting `deps/site/` in order to disable this behavior.

In exchange for some deviation from other build environments, `lxbuildenv` gives you several benefits that come in handy for hardware projects:

1. Python dicts enumerate in constant order, giving some consistency to build results.
1. You will probably be modifying code in the dependencies.  By keeping them inside the project directory, this becomes much simpler.
1. Additionally, all dependencies remain under version control, which you would otherwise lose when installing dependencies as packages.
1. Hardware, moreso than software, depends on exact version numbers.  By using `git` to track dependency versions, this build becomes more reproducible.
1. It is cross-platform, and works anywhere Xilinx does.
1. The `lxbuildenv` environment doesn't rely on opaque environment variables, or otherwise have a special environment you enter.  Everything is documented behind `--help` flags.

## Working with Dependencies ##

Dependencies are managed through `git`, and managing their usage is largely an exercise
in working with `git`.

For example, if you would like to make a change to `litex`, go into `deps/litex` and checkout
a new branch and create a new upstream repo.  If you're working on Github, you would do
something like fork the repo to your own organization.

As an example, assume `sutajiokousagi` has forked upstream `litex`:

```sh
$ cd deps/litex
$ git checkout -b new-feature
$ git remote add kosagi git@github.com:sutajiokousagi/litex.git
$ cd -
```

Then, make changes to `deps/litex` as needed.

When you want to merge changes upstream, go into `deps/litex/` and push the branch to your remote:

```sh
$ cd deps/litex
$ git push kosagi new-feature
$ cd -
```

Then you can go and open a Pull Request on Github.

## Fetching Updates ##

Dependencies are designed to be independent, and you should update them as needed.  To update a particular
dependency, go into that dependency's subdirectory and run `git pull`.  You may also find it easier to
pull updates from a particular dependency and merge them.  For example, if you're working on the `new-feature`
branch of `litex` and want to pull changes from upstream, run:

```sh
$ cd deps/litex
$ git fetch origin
$ git merge master
$ cd -
```

This will merge all changes from upstream onto your own branch.

## PyCharm integration ##

To use PyCharm, open this directory as a `Project` by going to the *File* menu and selecting *Open...*.  Make sure you open the entire directory, and not just a single file in this directory.

When you first open this project, you'll see lots of red squiggly lines indicating errors.  PyCharm needs to know about the dependency structure in order to allow you to drill down into modules and auto-complete statements.

Open this directory in PyCharm and expand the `deps/` directory.  Then hold down `Shift` and select all subdirectories under `deps/`.  This will include `litedram`, `liteeth`, and so on.

Then, right-click and select `Mark directory as...` and select `Sources Root`.  The red squiggly lines should go away, and PyCharm should now be configured.

When running your module from within PyCharm, you may find it useful to set environment variables.  You can use the `--lx-print-env` command.  For example: `./betrusted-ec.py --lx-print-env > pycharm.env` to create a `.env`-compatible file.  There are several PyCharm plugins that can make use of this file.

## Visual Studio Code integration ##

Visual Studio Code needs to know where modules are.  These are specified in environment variables, which are automatically read from a .env file in your project root.  Create this file to enable `pylint` and debugging in Visual Studio Code:

```sh
$ python ./betrusted-ec.py --lx-print-env > .env
```
